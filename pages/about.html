        <p>HELLO WORLD</p>
        <p>This is a brief introduction of myself</p>
        <p>I’m Mirëjeta, a student of programming for mobile and cloud devices on Riinvest College.
            As a computer science student, technology and innovations are my passion and a big part of
            my life purpose, my love for technology actuallystarted early on in my life
            while expermienting with old electircal devices.
            Since then I spent many years of commitment in improving my skills in this area by doing small projects with
            electronics or through coding and designing.
            I also identify myself as a teacher as that is my current job, I love working with young generations on
            improving the future, bringing our innovative ideas to the table
            and learning through experience.
            I also practice drawing on my free time since that is also something I excelled in since
            a young age.
            All this variety of career orientations in my opinion will not be a problem in mastering a particular field
            since I'm a strong believer that we should work towards things that we are passionate about and not limit
            ourself in a single filed.
